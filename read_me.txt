#About the Project:

COUNTING THE MOST FREQUENT WORDS IN A WEBPAGE.

This mini project is based on the Web Scraping concept developed at DIT University,Dehradun,India by Gagandeep Singh(Btech-CSE).
In this project I have scraped all the content from a webpage and filtered out all the words from the content that I have scraped.
I have removed all the special characters,digits,brackets and spaces (e.g. @,&,3,1,(,},],%,etc.)from the content.
I have counted the number of words and their frequency.
At last,I have plotted a graph between the top 10 frequently used words in the webpage.
